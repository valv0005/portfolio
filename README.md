## About the Project (How you created your web portfolio)

The project started with the design on February 17th, 2022, and finished with a High-Fidelity Digital prototype on March 22nd, 2022. With the designed prototype, the web portfolio project for the Web Development assignment started on March 24th, 2022. First, I focused on creating the HTML and CSS home page code with the mobile-first approach. Then, the tablet and finally the desktop version. 

After having the main structure, I create a copy of the homepage to create the about, projects, and contact pages. Then, the paper, thank you, and prototype subpages. For every HTML file, I had to adjust the CSS code to get the final result. When I finished the HTML and CSS code for every webpage, I validated my code using the W3 Validator for CSS and HTML. In some cases, I had to correct the HTML errors.

After the validation process, I submit the files on the Github repository stage all the changes, writing a message to commit and pushing the changes. Finally, I tested and corrected some errors. The project ended on April 20th, 2022 with a satisfactory result. 

### Challenges Faced 

1. The implementation of the Basic Picture and Source Elements code
2. Some images didn't show up in the Github repository link
3. Grid or Flexbox for the projects page

### Overcoming Challenges

1. I used a picture source generator, but this just confused me. So I decided to discuss this with the professor, and he recommends to use the Basic Example to implement the Picture and Source Elements. This example helps a lot in the project by doing it simply. 
2. In my local repository, the images are displayed correctly. However, when I submitted the project to the GitHub Repository, three images didn't show. I solved writing the correct format by adding two dots in the URL path. 
3. I was not sure about working with the flexbox. I tested using the flexbox, but the result was not the desired. So, I tried the grid system for this specific page. Definitely, the Grid system goes well implemented, and I love the result. The dilemma is which one is better. But I think you can try and test both to set what fits your project needs.

## What I learned

I learned to wisely build the HTML structure for creating the CSS and style the webpage to match the mockup. Coloured the containers on the CSS help a lot when you are starting to style the sections. Divide and conquer! It helped define the HTML sections to style the webpage. Sometimes the designed mockup is not consistent, and that means that I had to correct the mockup during the development process. For example, the top and bottom margins had different measures. I had to adjust some of my layouts.
